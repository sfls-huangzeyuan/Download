## Casear Cipher

1. Decode
   
   $P_i\equiv S_i+65\space or\space97-k(mod\space26)$
   
   $P_i$ is the i-th letter of the decoded text;
   
   $S_i$ is the i-th letter of the encoded text;
   
   $k$   is the integer of deviation.
   
   $65$ is the ASCII of 'A'
   
   $97$ is the ASCII of 'a'

2. Encode

        $P_i\equiv S_i+65\space or\space97+k(mod\space26)$

        $P_i$ is the i-th letter of the encoded text;

        $S_i$ is the i-th letter of the decoded text;

        $k$ is the integer of deviation.

        $65$ is the ASCII of 'A'

        $97$ is the ASCII of 'a'
